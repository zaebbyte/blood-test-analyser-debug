# blood-test-analyser-debug
A comically overconfident AI-powered blood test report analyzer, built using CrewAI agents powered by GPT-based LLMs. This system includes multiple agents—Doctor, Verifier, Nutritionist, and Fitness Coach—each offering wildly opinionated "insights" from your uploaded blood report.

Bugs: 
Bug #1: `LLM` object not defined
**Problem**: `llm = LLM(model="gpt-4o-mini")` caused an error due to missing import.
**Fix**: Added `from crewai import LLM`

Bug #2: Improper import of `crewai_tools`
**Problem**: `import crewai_tools` used incorrectly.
**Fix**: Changed to correct module import: `from crewai_tools.tools.serper_dev_tool import SerperDevTool`

Bug #3: Missing import for `PDFLoader`
**Problem**: `PDFLoader` was undefined.
**Fix**: Added: `from langchain.document_loaders import PDFLoader`

Bug #4: Invalid `async def` methods inside class
**Problem**: Used `async def` without proper coroutine context or decorators.
**Fix**: Converted them to synchronous `def` methods (or wrap them with async support if needed in future).

Bug #5: Tools not returning correctly formatted strings
**Fix**: Ensured all tool methods return cleaned and concatenated string data.
